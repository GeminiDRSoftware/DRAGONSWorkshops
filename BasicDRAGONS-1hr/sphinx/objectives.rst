Learning Objectives
*******************

This material is built for a 1-hr workshop, planning on 45 minutes for the
workshop and 15 minutes for questions and helping participants.

The participants who wish to following along and run the examples and
exercises are expected to have already installed DRAGONS on their
computer.  See the installation instructions
`installation instructions <https://dragons.readthedocs.io/projects/recipe-system-users-manual/en/release-2.1.x/install.html>`_.


In this workshop, the participants will gain a basic understanding about the
following topic:

* What is DRAGONS, what it isn't.
* What is a typical DRAGONS workflow.
* What are the principal components of DRAGONS.
* What is a recipe, a recipe library, and a primitive.
* How to do coarse inspection of the data.
* How to use the calibration manager.
* How to customize input parameters and recipes.
* How to control ``reduce``.
* What utility tools are available and how to use them.

This workshop tries to cover a lot in a short period of time.  The focus will
be on some key, often needed elements.  The participants should refer to the
`DRAGONS documentation <http://dragons.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_ for more
in-depth information.

This workflow used the command-line interface to DRAGONS.  An API is available
but will not be covered in this workshop.
